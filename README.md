# CCraft / The Arcane Brony's MC Clone
This is a little project of mine, to see how far I would be able to get,
and to learn a few things about efficient programming.

Pull requests are welcome!
Feel free to point out things I'm doing wrong!

# Current performance: Horrible
When it does compile, it runs really slowly. This is due to unoptimised, and generally crappy code.
Got a suggestion? Let me know!
